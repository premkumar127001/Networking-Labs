# 🕵️ Networking Labs — Gamified Packet Tracer Missions  

Welcome, Agent.  
This repository is a collection of **gamified networking labs** built in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  

Unlike traditional labs, these are designed as **missions with stories**.  
You won’t just configure devices — you’ll play the role of an **agent**, solving puzzles and uncovering secrets using networking concepts like ARP, MAC tables, CDP, LLDP, and more.  

The goal is simple: make learning **networking fun, practical, and adventurous**.
